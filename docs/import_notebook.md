If you are someone who is familiar with Jupyter notebooks and want the familiar feeling out of ZEPL, you can go for JUNO look and feel. If you import a Jupyter notebook, the default look and feel mode would be JUNO(You can change it later inside the notebook, if you want). You can share notebooks in JUNO mode too.
