<span class="middle-font">Instances? Spaces?</span>

For truly using ZEPL service, there are two terms need to be understood. 
<br/>

<span class="submenu-font">Instance</span>

**Instance** is not a new word. It is just a unit for which you can connect [Apache Zeppelin](http://zeppelin.apache.org/).
As you can see in the above illustration, you can manage several **Apache Zeppelin Instances** in your ZEPL account. 
Once you add a new instance to ZEPL, it will generate a **Unique Token** only for that instance. 
This token is used to identify your instance with ZEPL. You can find more detailed information about Apache Zeppelin integration in [Integration with Apache Zeppelin](zeppelin_integration.md) section.

<span class="note-font">You might wonder how you can install and configure Apache Zeppelin. 
If so, please read [Apache Zeppelin Quickstart](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/install/install.html) and [Configuration](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.1/install/configuration.html) first.</span>

<span class="submenu-font">Space</span>

ZEPL **Space** is a kind of room for sharing notebooks. 
Using space, you can gather your own and shared notebooks shared from your team members efficiently. 
When you create a space, you can invite your team members. 
Only invited people can have an access permission to the shared notebooks.
For the further details, please refer to [Sharing your Notebooks](sharing_notebooks.md).
