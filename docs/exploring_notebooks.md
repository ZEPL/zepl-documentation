<span class="header-font">Explore Public Notebooks</span>

[ZEPL Explore](https://www.zepl.com/explore) is a community page for sharing Apache Zeppelin notebooks. 
As long as the notebook is set as **Published(a.k.a Public)**, you can get the public URI and anyone(even non-ZEPL users) can see the notebook.

You can label your notebook with one of the showcase tags, so it will appear under particular Showcase section inside **Explore** page.

If you select the showcases when you set your notebook to **Published(a.k.a Public)** mode, the notebook will be added under that showcase. 
Now you can show off awesome notebooks through the ZEPL!
