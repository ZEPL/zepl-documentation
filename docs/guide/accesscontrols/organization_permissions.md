# Organization Permissions

# Permission Model

Permissions in Zepl are organized by centrally managed Security Policies. These policies can be highly customized with granular and specific permissions around actions in the product. After understanding the product level permissions available to you in the policies, you can assign team members to use those policies and gain access to those permissions. 

Each team member can be assigned multiple Security Policies, and their permissions to perform actions in Zepl are the sum of all the permissions granted to them by the Security Policies. Zepl provides several convenient Security Policies for you to use out of the box, and it's easy for you to build policies customized for the particular needs of your enterprise.

# View Security Policies

Security Policies are located under Settings. Not everyone can view and edit security policies for an organization - you need the appropriate permission to do so. This permission is granted by default to "Organization Owners" and "Security Administrators".

# Edit Policy Permissions

When looking at the list of security policies, click on any security policy to see what permissions are assigned to that policy. To edit what permissions are associated with a policy, you simply need to click on the check mark next to a policy. To make your edits permanent changes to the policy, simply click Save.

# Create New Policy

Creating a new policy is very similar to viewing and editing an existing one. Click "New Policy" above the list of current security policies to start the process. Give the policy a name, select the permissions you want associated with the policy, and click "Save" to finish creating the policy.

# Assigning Policies to Users

To assign users to policies, navigate to the Members page under Settings. You can assign policies to an individual team member by clicking on their name to access their profile page. Select any policies you would like to assign to the user on the members profile page and click save.

Assigning policies to users requires a permission of "Assign and unassign security policies". This permission is granted by default to "Organization Owners" and "Security Administrators".

Whenever you invite a user to join your organization, you can also assign policies to this user at the same time if you have the permission to assign users to policies.

# Default Policies

Zepl comes with several out-of-the-box policies that you can use to grant permissions to organization members. These policies can be changed to customize your needs.
